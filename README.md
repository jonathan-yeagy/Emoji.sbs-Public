## Technologies Used
- PHP 7.3.33
- MySQL 5.6.43
- HTML 5
- CSS 3

## Getting Started

**Entrypoint:** index.php

> **Note:** You'll need to create a SQL database in order to use this.

### How it works

This project combines a SQL database, Discord's API, and PHP so that users may login with their Discord account, and make requests for emojis on servers both the user and the corresponding bot for this server are a part of. It then adds the data to the SQL database in order to store which emoji needs to be created.

## Context

### Why Create this?
I created emoji.sbs so that my friends, and I have a place to request custom emojis we need created in Discord. I've often found that there's always custom emojis that need created, but unfortunately get forgotten by the time I get a chance to sit down and create emojis. Thus, I decided to create emoji.sbs.

### Why Create Emojis
I create emojis because I enjoy having a bunch of little icons that replace words in Discord. It's very satisfying to me. I joke that this endeavor won't be complete until I can communicate in emojiglyphics (hieroglyphics but with emojis).

I also enjoy using my skills with GIMP and Inkscape to create emojis, and find graphic design to be an enjoyable and relaxing task.

There's even been instances where I've been able to run some JavaScript in order to download emojis in mass.

> **Note:** This project is an ongoing work in progress, and while functioning, is not complete at this time. Further features and refinement will be implemented at a later date.
